# Scalable-VHDL-Design-Tool-Flow


    

Here we present a Scalable VHDL design tool flow which  is automated, with error handling capabilities at different stages. It helps to generate scalable VHDL designs, and an implementation bit file, from a single intermediate VHDL design file. This tool flow helps the VHDL hardware designers to generate a single intermediate VHDL design file, with multiple design parameters. It also helps the end-users of VHDL hardware designs in choosing, and generating the right design parameter bit file according to there requirement.

Tool flow source files contains the original code for scalable VHDl design tool flow, in that you need run the file name scalable.py file for the trade off branch off tool flow, and tripleDES.py file for the implementation branch of tool flow. 

This source files consists of four Intermediate VHDl design files in order to run the both types of the tool flow.(design1.vhd, design2.vhd, design3.vhd, design4.vhd)
